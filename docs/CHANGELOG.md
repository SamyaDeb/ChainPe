# Changelog

All notable changes to ChainPe are documented here.

## [3.0.0] — 2026-11-06 (Arc, ETHGlobal Mumbai)

Built during ETHGlobal Mumbai. Details and proof: [`docs/arc/`](arc/README.md) and [`docs/arc/PROOF.md`](arc/PROOF.md).

### Changed
- The npm packages lost the Avalanche name: `@chainpeavax/cli` is now `chainpe`, `@chainpeavax/sdk` is `chainpe-sdk`, `@chainpeavax/ai-tools` is `chainpe-ai-tools`, and `@chainpeavax/agent` is `chainpe-agent`. New versions: `chainpe` 3.0.0, `chainpe-sdk` 0.3.0, `chainpe-ai-tools` 0.3.0, `chainpe-agent` 3.0.0.
- The CLI now runs on Circle's Arc (`arc-testnet`, `arc`). Avalanche support was removed from the CLI; the June version stays at tag `avalanche-june-2026`.
- Moved from x402 v1 to x402 v2.
- Payments settle through Circle's Facilitator Service, before the provider's API is called.

### Added
- Circle Gateway nanopayments as a second payment option, plus `chainpe deposit`, `balance` and `withdraw`.
- `ChainPeAccounts` contract on Arc testnet for provider accounts and the Pro plan, built and deployed with Arc Studio.
- `chainpe identity`, `register`, `deregister`, `list`, `plan`, `upgrade` and `doctor`.
- `chainpe-cloud`: wallet sign-in, telemetry, and revenue verified against Arc and Circle's records.
- Provider dashboard (`apps/arc-dashboard`), built with Arc Studio.
